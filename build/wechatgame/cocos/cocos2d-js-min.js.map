At target phase: dispatch to the listeners of the real target<br/>\n     * 3. Bubbling phase: dispatch in bubble targets (`_getBubblingTargets`), e.g. parents in node tree, from the real target to root<br/>\n     * In any moment of the dispatching process, it can be stopped via `event.stopPropagation()` or `event.stopPropagationImmidiate()`.<br/>\n     * It's the recommended way to register touch/mouse event for Node,<br/>\n     * please do not use cc.eventManager directly for Node.<br/>\n     * You can also register custom event and use `emit` to trigger custom event on Node.<br/>\n     * For such events, there won't be capturing and bubbling phase, your event will be dispatched directly to its listeners registered on the same node.<br/>\n     * You can also pass event callback parameters with `emit` by passing parameters after `type`.\n     * !#zh\n     * 在节点上注册指定类型的回调函数，也可以设置 target 用于绑定响应函数的 this 对象。<br/>\n     * 鼠标或触摸事件会被系统调用 dispatchEvent 方法触发，触发的过程包含三个阶段：<br/>\n     * 1. 捕获阶段：派发事件给捕获目标（通过 `_getCapturingTargets` 获取），比如，节点树中注册了捕获阶段的父节点，从根节点开始派发直到目标节点。<br/>\n     * 2. 目标阶段：派发给目标节点的监听器。<br/>\n     * 3. 冒泡阶段：派发事件给冒泡目标（通过 `_getBubblingTargets` 获取），比如，节点树中注册了冒泡阶段的父节点，从目标节点开始派发直到根节点。<br/>\n     * 同时您可以将事件派发到父节点或者通过调用 stopPropagation 拦截它。<br/>\n     * 推荐使用这种方式来监听节点上的触摸或鼠标事件，请不要在节点上直接使用 cc.eventManager。<br/>\n     * 你也可以注册自定义事件到节点上，并通过 emit 方法触发此类事件，对于这类事件，不会发生捕获冒泡阶段，只会直接派发给注册在该节点上的监听器<br/>\n     * 你可以通过在 emit 方法调用时在 type 之后传递额外的参数作为事件回调的参数列表\n     * @method on\n     * @param {String|Node.EventType} type - A string representing the event type to listen for.<br>See {{#crossLink \"Node/EventTyupe/POSITION_CHANGED\"}}Node Events{{/crossLink}} for all builtin events.\n     * @param {Function} callback - The callback that will be invoked when the event is dispatched.

It has the minimum z index and cannot be modified, because they can't be displayed over real children.<br/>\n * 2. The positioning of private nodes is also special, they will consider the left bottom corner of the parent node's bounding box as the origin of local coordinates.<br/>\n *    In this way, they can be easily kept inside the bounding box.<br/>\n * Currently, it's used by RichText component and TileMap component.\n * !#zh\n * Cocos Creator 场景中的私有节点类。<br/>\n * 私有节点在编辑器中不可见，对用户透明。<br/>\n * 通常私有节点是被一些特殊的组件创建出来作为父节点的一部分而存在的，理论上来说，它们不是子节点，而是父节点的组成部分。<br/>\n * 私有节点有两个非常重要的特性：<br/>\n * 1. 它有着最小的渲染排序的 Z 轴深度，并且无法被更改，因为它们不能被显示在其他正常子节点之上。<br/>\n * 2. 它的定位也是特殊的，对于私有节点来说，父节点包围盒的左下角是它的局部坐标系原点，这个原点相当于父节点的位置减去它锚点的偏移。这样私有节点可以比较容易被控制在包围盒之中。<br/>\n * 目前在引擎中，RichText 和 TileMap 都有可能生成私有节点。\n * @class PrivateNode\n * @constructor\n * @param {String} name\n * @extends Node\n */\nlet PrivateNode = cc.Class({\n    name: 'cc.PrivateNode',\n    extends: Node,\n\n    properties: {\n        x: {\n            get () {\n                return this._originPos.x;\n            },\n            set (value) {\n                var localPosition = this._originPos;\n                if (value !== localPosition.x) {\n                    localPosition.x = value;\n                    this._posDirty(true);\n                }\n            },\n            override: true\n        },\n        y: {\n            get () {\n                return this._originPos.y;\n            },\n            set (value) {\n                var localPosition = this._originPos;\n                if (value !== localPosition.y) {\n                    localPosition.y = value;\n                    this._posDirty(true);\n                }\n            },\n            override: true\n        },\n        zIndex: {\n            get () {\n                return cc.macro.MIN_ZINDEX;\n            },\n            set () {\n                cc.warnID(1638);\n            },\n            override: true\n        },\n        showInEditor: {\n            default: false,\n            editorOnly: true,\n            override: true\n        }\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * @method constructor\n     * @param {String} [name]\n     */\n    ctor (name) {\n        this._localZOrder = cc.macro.MIN_ZINDEX << 16;\n        this._originPos = cc.v2();\n        if (CC_EDITOR) {\n            this._objFlags |= HideInHierarchy;\n        }\n    },\n\n    _posDirty (sendEvent) {\n        this.setLocalDirty(LocalDirtyFlag.POSITION);\n        !CC_NATIVERENDERER && (this._renderFlag |= RenderFlow.FLAG_TRANSFORM);\n        if (sendEvent === true && (this._eventMask & POSITION_ON)) {\n            this.emit(Node.EventType.POSITION_CHANGED);\n        }\n    },\n\n    _updateLocalMatrix() {\n        if (!this._localMatDirty) return;\n\n        let parent = this.parent;\n        if (parent) {\n            // Position correction for transform calculation\n            this._trs[0] = this._originPos.x -

The event object then makes its way through\n * the scene graph until it reaches the event target, at which point it begins its return trip through\n * the scene graph. This round-trip journey to the event target is conceptually divided into three phases:\n * - The capture phase comprises the journey from the root to the last node before the event target's node\n * - The target phase comprises only the event target node\n * - The bubbling phase comprises any subsequent nodes encountered on the return trip to the root of the tree\n * See also: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-flow\n *\n * Event targets can implement the following methods:\n *  - _getCapturingTargets\n *  - _getBubblingTargets\n *\n * !#zh\n * 事件目标是事件触发时，分派的事件对象，Node 是最常见的事件目标，\n * 但是其他对象也可以是事件目标。<br/>\n *\n * @class EventTarget\n * @extends CallbacksInvoker\n */\nfunction EventTarget () {\n    CallbacksInvoker.call(this);\n}\njs.extend(EventTarget, CallbacksInvoker);\n\nvar proto = EventTarget.prototype;\n\n/**\n * !#en Checks whether the EventTarget object has any callback registered for a specific type of event.\n * !#zh 检查事件目标对象是否有为特定类型的事件注册的回调。\n * @method hasEventListener\n * @param {String} type - The type of event.\n * @return {Boolean} True if a callback of the specified type is registered;

key value pair.<br/>\n * Each item always contains the following property:<br/>\n * - id: The identification of the item, usually it's identical to url<br/>\n * - url: The url <br/>\n * - type: The type, it's the extension name of the url by default, could be specified manually too.<br/>\n * - error: The error happened in pipeline will be stored in this property.<br/>\n * - content: The content processed by the pipeline, the final result will also be stored in this property.<br/>\n * - complete: The flag indicate whether the item is completed by the pipeline.<br/>\n * - states: An object stores the states of each pipe the item go through, the state can be: Pipeline.ItemState.WORKING | Pipeline.ItemState.ERROR | Pipeline.ItemState.COMPLETE<br/>\n * <br/>\n * Item can hold other custom
